This project is a neural network model aimed at predicting which zip 
codes are primed for a jump in real estate value. The project can be broken down into 
four phases:

1. The base notebook which contains the majority of the feature generation, the 
construction and testing of the neural network, as well as the majority of the 
visualizations.

2. The reviews and business information feature generation file. This contains social 
media reviews manipulated with word2vec and converted into features for the model as well 
as reducing the business dataset to be more computationally manageable.

3. The USA map visualizations.

4. The deck to present the project.

There are numbers following the file names of the reviews and business folder and they are 
meant to be read in order from 1-4
