This is my professional portfolio. Within this repository you will find my final capstone project that is a neural network and natural language processing project aimed at predicting which zip codes are most likely to gain property value.

There is also a natural language processing semi-supervised project aimed at clustering news articles together based on article type.

If you only want to look at one project please refer to the final capstone.
